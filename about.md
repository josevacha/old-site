####Who am I?
Hi, I'm Lin. I'm a life scientist by training, now transitioning into the world of data science. This blog is an account of this process, and also hopefully a resource for others who are thinking of doing the same. 

####What was I doing before?
I am just in the process of completing a PhD from the University of Cambridge in molecular genetics. I was studying plant evolution. You can read more about my research [here] (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lin_Taylor). Before my PhD, I spent a year working as a data analyst and researcher at the Royal Botanic Gardens in London. 

####Why data science?
There are many reasons why this route is appealing to me right now:
- **I want to learn skills that are highly transferrable and in high demand.** There is a huge and growing demand for people with programming, statistics, and technology skills. Even within my own discipline in the life sciences, it's been difficult to ignore the growing need for people who can clean, analyse and make sense of large datasets such as gene expression data from microarrays, genomic and transcriptomic sequencing data, and  . These sorts of skills are likely to become an even more valuable skill in the future. So, it makes sense to get involved as early as possible.

- **There is the possibility to making a large and positive impact on the world**. Much of the hype surrounding data science seems to be about what it can do for businesses e.g. Netflix famously uses big data analytics to predict the success of its a great need for, and which can potentially have a large impact on the world. Data science combines aspects of science, programming and storytelling, all things that I enjoy. Right now, this industry is growing fast, and there are a lot of opportunities opening up for people with the right skill set. It seems like the prime time to get stuck in.

 
####What else?
I love learning about the natural world (especially [plants](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lin_Taylor)), and our place in the universe. I am excited about what humanity will discover in the next 10-50 years. I also love cooking, eating, and making things. My favourite animal is the giant panda.
