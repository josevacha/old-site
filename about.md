####Who am I?
Hi, I'm Lin. I'm a life scientist by training, now transitioning into the world of data science. This blog is an account of this process, and also hopefully a resource for others who are thinking of doing the same. 

####What was I doing before?
I am just in the process of completing a PhD from the University of Cambridge in molecular genetics. I was studying [plant evolution] (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lin_Taylor). Before my PhD, I spent a year working as a data analyst and researcher at the Royal Botanic Gardens in London. 

####Why data science?
There are several reasons why I'm starting down this road:

- **I want to learn skills that are highly transferrable and in high demand.** There is a huge and growing demand for people with programming, statistics, and technology skills. Even within my own discipline in the life sciences, it's been difficult to ignore the growing need for people who can clean, analyse and make sense of large datasets such as gene expression data from microarrays, genomic and transcriptomic sequencing data, and  . These sorts of skills are likely to become an even more valuable skill in the future. There is also an incredible wealth of learning resources online, and these are being added to all the time. So, it makes sense to get involved as early as possible.

- **There is the possibility to making a large and positive impact on the world**. Much of the hype surrounding data science seems to be about what it can do for businesses e.g. Netflix famously uses [big data analytics](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/for-house-of-cards-using-big-data-to-guarantee-its-popularity.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) to predict the success of its content, and  .... However, the power of data can also be harnessed for socially-motivated causes. For example, organisations like [DataKind] (http://www.datakind.org/) use data science to help non-profits to become more effective. Healthcare companies ... This feeds into the Effective Altruism movement (exemplified by organisations such as [the Centre for Effective Altruism](https://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/), [80,000 hours] (http://80000hours.org/), and [Give Well] (http://www.givewell.org/)),  which seeks to use evidence-based analysis to help others as much as possible. I want to participate in leveraging these technologies to make large, positive impacts for human welfare.

- **It's fun!** Data science combines aspects of science, programming and storytelling, all things that I enjoy. A couple of years ago I discovered I get a lot of satisfaction out of programming, and learning how to manipulate things through this medium.

 
####What else?
I love learning about the natural world (especially [plants](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lin_Taylor)), and our place in the universe. I am excited about what humanity will discover in the next 10-50 years. I also love cooking, eating, and making things. My favourite animal is the giant panda.
