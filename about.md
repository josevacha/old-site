####Who am I?
Hello there. My name is Lin Taylor. I am a life scientist by training, now transitioning into the world of data science. This blog is an account of this process, and also hopefully a resource for others who want to make the jump from less conventional backgrounds.

####What was I doing before?
I am just in the process of completing a PhD from the University of Cambridge in molecular genetics. I was studying how plants have evolved to attract pollinators. You can read more about my research [here] (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lin_Taylor). Before my PhD, I spent a year working as a data analyst and researcher at the Royal Botanic Gardens in London. 

####Why data science?
I am excited about the possibility of learning skills that there is currently a great need for, and which can potentially have a large impact on the world. Data science combines aspects of science, programming and storytelling, all things that I enjoy. Right now, this industry is growing fast, and there are a lot of opportunities opening up for people with the right skill set. It seems like the prime time to get stuck in.
