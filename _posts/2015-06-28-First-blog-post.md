Howdy! Welcome to my blog. A bit of background about who I am and where I am right now: I'm finishing up a PhD in plant molecular genetics at the University of Cambridge (and by finishing up I mean I'm waiting for my supervisor to send me her final edits before I can submit for real!). I'm currently in Cambridge MA, just outside of Boston (it was difficult to get out of Cambridge...) where I'm spending the summer visiting friends and learning data science. I have a place on the [Science to Data Science] ("http://www.s2ds.org/") (otherwise known as 'S2DS') 2015 programme in London in August, which is essentially a summer school to help people with analytic PhDs transition into the data science industry. A big component of S2DS is about working with industry sponsors on real-world projects. I found out recently that I've been placed on the [Intelliflo] ("http://www.intelliflo.com/") team; Intelliflo make software for the finance industry.  

I'm a couple of weeks into this trip, so I thought I'd use this first post to outline what I've been doing so far, what tools I'm using, and what I want to achieve in the next few weeks. 

###Data science curriculum
Self-directed learning comes with its benefits and its challenges. On the one hand, I can learn whatever I want, On the other hand, there are so many open source/freely-available learning tools on the internet right now, it has actually been difficult to pare them down and pick out what courses would be the best use of my time. It doesn't help that the data science landscape looks like [this]("http://nirvacana.com/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/RoadToDataScientist1.png"). I've found it really useful reading the [blogs]("https://datascientistjourney.wordpress.com/category/data-science/") or [websites]("http://datasciencemasters.org/") of others who have done similar things in this space.

###Tools for work hacking
I like to be organised with my work habits, so finding systems that maximise my efficiency and sustain my motivation are important to me (this seems to be a large part of what one learns during a PhD, especially during writing-up stages). I'm a fan of Cal Newport's [blog] ("http://calnewport.com/blog/"), where he writes extensively about finding space for [deep work]("http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/11/21/knowledge-workers-are-bad-at-working-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it/"). I'd like to try systematically applying some of these principles to my own work habits. It'll probaby take time and trial and error to work out the best system for me.

For the time being, I'm breaking up my working hours using the [pomodoro techinique]("http://pomodorotechnique.com/"), a habit carried over from hours of thesis-writing. I'm also using [toggl]("www.toggl.com") to track my work activities. Toggl has a really nice interface, but a big drawback from my perspective is that if you want to export to your data as a csv file then you have to pay monies for the premium version. I'd like access to my own data so I can use it for data exploration when I've racked up enough hours. So, toggl is just a standby until I get around to customising a [Python tool]("https://github.com/linbug/Glock") I made previously with a friend that logs Google calendar events from the command line. It should only be a few additions to make it so that each activity also gets added to a csv file. Maybe I'll write a blog post about it!
